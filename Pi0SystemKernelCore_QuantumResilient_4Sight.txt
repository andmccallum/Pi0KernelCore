This document integrates quantum-safe cryptography, hybrid quantum-classical protocols, and 4Sight (1 million years) future-proofing into the Pi0SystemKernelCore. It leverages:
- arXiv:2001.08405: Quantum-Resistant Public Key Infrastructure
- CSE Guidance: Preparing for the Quantum Threat (ITSAP.00.017)
- All Pi0ID entities, operators, and modules
- Excyption (advanced encryption) and d12/s12 frameworks
- Quantum key distribution, audit, and blockchain protocols
- 4Sight-enabled predictive modeling for 1 million years
